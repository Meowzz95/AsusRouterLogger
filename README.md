# AsusRouterLogger
A hobby project that replaces the not-so-smart router app

This program should run on a 24-7 machine(in my case RPI), It collects information from the router admin portal and sends to a remote server for processing.
The server project will be held in a different repository. Link to be updated :)

# Platform support
Tested on MAC and RPI, however, Windows and Linux are theoretically supported as well.
