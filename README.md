# AsusRouterLogger
A hobby project that replaces the not-so-smart router app

This program should run on a 24-7 machine(in my case RPI), It collects information from the router admin portal and sends to a remote server for processing.
The server project will be held in a different repository. Link to be updated :)

# Email notification
An email will be sent to admin if there is/are device(s) going on/offline.

# Platform support
Tested on MAC and RPI, however, Windows and Linux are theoretically supported as well.
